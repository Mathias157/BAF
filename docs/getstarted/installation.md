# Installation

GAMS 47, Antares 8.6.1 and Python 3.9.11+ are required to run the BAF.

The pre-processing scripts requires R and the [R packages for Antares](https://github.com/rte-antares-rpackage), developed by RTE. However, this is only required if you want to do structual changes through python/R on the Antares model.
