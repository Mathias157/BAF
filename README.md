# Balmorel and Antares Soft-Linking Framework

This Balmorel-Antares soft-linking framework (BAF) was used in [Rosendal et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125512), in an investigation of soft-linking strategies for coupling investment and operational models. The specific data of that study could unfortunately not be shared, but the framework will be reused here for a second, open-data application, using the [OSMOSE WP1 dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/7323821). 

Get started by reading the [documentation](https://mathias157.github.io/BAF), which contain information on installation and development.
